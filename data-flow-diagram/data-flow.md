## Key Data Elements

### User Data

- email, password_hash, name, profile_pic, role, preferences  

### Property Data

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data (passwords, payment info) is **encrypted**  
- API endpoints use **JWT authentication**  
- **Rate limiting** prevents abuse of services  
- **Input validation** prevents injection attacks  

---

## Performance Optimizations

- **Redis caching** for frequently accessed data (search results, property details)  
- **Database indexing** for faster queries  
- **Pagination** for large result sets  
- Optimized database queries
