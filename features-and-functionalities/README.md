## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The backend system follows a **modular architecture** with clearly separated domains:

1. **Authentication Service** → Handles user login, tokens, and roles  
2. **Property Service** → Manages property listings and availability  
3. **Booking Service** → Coordinates reservation flow and conflict checks  
4. **Payment Service** → Integrates with external payment providers  
5. **Notification Service** → Sends emails, SMS, or push alerts  
6. **Admin Service** → Provides control and monitoring capabilities  

Data is stored in a **relational database** (PostgreSQL/MySQL), with caching (Redis) for performance and availability.
